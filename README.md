- 👋 Hi, I’m @Markkoss2
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to program professionally and I am self-taught.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScrip, Node, etc.
- 💞️ I still have a lot to learn, if anyone has or knows of a good free course to master JS, Node, React, etc please let me know. I am currently following Fernando Herrera courses on Udemy.
- 📫 You can contact me using the form on my website.

It seems curious, but if my life took a 180 degree turn, programming always caught my attention and even though I teach drawing and using 3d design programs, today I am focused on learning something else.
